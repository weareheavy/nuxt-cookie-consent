# Configuration

To start using the module you have to have [configured a provider](/documentation#configure-your-provider).

Currently this module supports [Cookieinformation](https://cookieinformation.com), [CookieBot](https://cookiebot.com) and [CookieScript](https://cookiescript.com). An account for the respective service is required.

## Scripts
You can configure which scripts loads for each consent category.
Each category accepts an array of script definitions. It uses the same interface as 

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig(() => {
    // ...
    cookieConsent: {
        scripts: {
            necessary: [
                {
                    id: 'uniqeId',
                    src: 'https://example.com/script.js'
                }
            ],
        }
    }
})
```
